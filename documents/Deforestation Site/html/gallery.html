				<h1>Indigenous Tribes</h1>
				
				<p>
				Indigenous tribes in Africa are under threat from deforestation and affect them on a cultural and physical level. 
				Deforestation forces them to leave their land due to the loss of animals and plants that they depend on to live. With the loss of hunting grounds, many of these tribes may begin to have conflicting territories, which would most likely resolve into violence to compete for the few remaining resources. 
				These tribes have the smallest carbon footprint, many manage to have a carbon negative impact, but suffer the worst from climate change. The higher temperatures mean that disease that thrive on heat and are waterborne such as cholera can ravage a tribe, water droughts would be more common as well as an increase in forest fires (These forest fires resulting in the release of more co2). 
				 The indigenous people being evicted from their ancestral homeland are not an uncommon occurrence. They are generally displaced for plantations or even to make way for roads. Although this violates many human rights laws, not much is done to help these people. 
				 Effectively, deforestation is making these indigenous tribes less and less able to sustain themselves, which will only result in the loss of their culture.
