				<h1>Main causes of Deforestation</h1>
				
				<p>  
				In the 1990s, deforestation in Africa was at its worst. 
				It had been estimated that Africa had roughly 35% of the worlds tropical forests that would be about 550 million hectares. 
				During this time Africa was above the yearly average of 0.8% of global deforestation. 
				As Africa is a developing country, it relies mostly on wood fuel. 
				Despite Africas use of woodfuel, it only makes up about 15% of the total amount of trees cut down. 
				The biggest drivers of deforestation are agricultural. Almost 80% of deforestation is done because of agriculture. 
				30% from intensive agriculture, and 50% from subsistence agriculture. 
				I.A. has little produce but high use of chemicals and pesticides, which can cause an increase in production but also causes environmental pollution, erosion and water poisoning. 
				S.A. is a farm that focuses on growing enough food to feed a family. It general consists of crops and a few animals. 
				To prevent deforestation on such a large scale laws have been past that dont allow the cutting down of endangered trees or areas where endangered animals are known to be and an agreement from logging companies to replant a portion of the trees they cut down.
