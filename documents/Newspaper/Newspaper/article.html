					</div>
					
					<!--Drop Cap One-->
					<p class="MainStoryParagraph"><span class="firstcharacter">T</span>he recent attacks in Paris and Beirut and the 
						downing of a Russian airliner in Egypt were the first results of a centrally planned terrorism 
						campaign by a wing of the Islamic State leadership that oversees “external” targets, according 
						to American and European intelligence officials. The Islamic State’s overseas operations planning 
						cell offers strategic guidance, training and funding for actions aimed at inflicting the maximum 
						possible civilian casualties, but leaves the task of picking the time, place and manner of the 
						attacks largely to trusted operatives on the ground, the officials said. 
					</p>
					
					<br>
					</br>
					
					<p class="normalParagraph">Carrying out attacks far from the Islamic State’s base in Iraq and Syria represents an evolution 
						of the group’s previous model of exhorting followers to take up arms wherever they live — but without 
						significant help from the group. And it upends the view held by the United States and its allies of 
						the Islamic State as a regional threat, attacks largely to trusted operatives on the ground, the officials said.
						with a new assessment that the group poses a whole new set of risks.

						<p class="Quote">Once the Islamic State possessed territory that provided them sanctuary and 
							allowed them to act with impunity, they like other jihadist groups inevitably 
							turned to external attacks.
						</p>
						<p class="QuoteGuy">- William Wechsler, senior at Center 
							for American Progress
						</p>
						</div>
					<div class="col-md-2"><span class="NineNine">”</span></div>
					
					<br>
					</br>
					
					<p class="normalParagraph">One possible motivation of the change in strategy by the Islamic State, 
						also called ISIS or ISIL, is to seize leadership of the global jihad from Al Qaeda — from 
						which the Islamic State broke away in 2013. The attack on the Radisson Blu hotel in Mali on 
						Friday was probably carried out by two Qaeda-linked groups, suggesting, as one senior European 
						counterterrorism official put it, “The race is on between ISIS and Al Qaeda to see who can attack 
						the West the best.” American and European intelligence officials said they based their new assessment
						of the external operations structure on intercepted communications.
					</p>
					
					<br>
					</br>
					
					<p class="normalParagraph">Investigators are still piecing together details of how the Paris plotters 
						communicated, but two Western counterterrorism officials revealed that there were electronic 
						communications between Islamic State leaders in Syria and Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the man suspected 
						to be the architect of the assault, in the weeks before the attacks.Similar evidence analyzed 
						after the bombings in Beirut, the Lebanese capital, suggest that those strikes were directed 
						from Syria and conducted by operatives on the ground. The downing of the Russian airliner 
						followed a larger Islamic State goal to strike Russian interests.
					</p>
					
					<br>
					</br>
					
					<!--Drop Cap Two-->
					<p class="normalParagraph"><span class="firstcharacter">A</span>ccording to American and European officials,
						the man overseeing the attacks outside Iraq and Syria is Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, a 38-year-old 
						Syrian who is the official spokesman for the Islamic State and one of the most trusted lieutenants 
						of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the group’s supreme leader. But it is in his role as head of external 
						operations that Mr. Adnani has drawn intensified scrutiny from Western officials. Mr. Adnani is 
						best known for a 42-minute audio statement issued on social media in September 2014 in which he 
						called on individual Muslims living in the West to kill civilians.
					</p>
					
					<br>

					<div class="col-md-8">
						<p class="Quote">If you can, kill a disbelieving American or European — especially 
							the spiteful and filthy French, or an Australian, or a Canadian, then rely upon Allah, and kill 
							him in any manner or way.
						</p>
						<p class="QuoteGuy">-  Abdelhamid Abaaoud, Royal Asshat
						</p>
						</div>
					<div class="col-md-2"><span class="NineNine">”</span></div>
					
					<br>
					</br>
					
					<p class="normalParagraph">As a result, Mr. Adnani now has a $5 million bounty on his head, offered by 
						the United States, and is on the kill list for the American-led air campaign in Iraq and Syria. 
						“Adnani has been a key figure in external planning since ISIS rose to prominence over a year 
						ago,” said Matthew G. Olsen. Mr. Adnani’s stature and operational focus are also revealed in 
						an analysis of nearly 1,000 video messages the Islamic State has disseminated over social media 
						in the past two years, which was conducted by Javier Lesaca, a visiting scholar at George 
						Washington University’s school of media and public affairs.
					</p>
					
					<br>
					</br>
					
					<p class="normalParagraph">While Mr. Adnani is the Islamic State’s chief spokesman and propagandist, 
						his photograph is not shown by the group in its videos, most likely to protect him. So Mr. 
						Adnani makes frequent audio statements. “ISIS has never shown a video with images of al-Adnani,” 
						Mr. Lesaca said. “The only reason for this is to enhance his security.” Mr. Lesaca’s analysis shows 
						that Russia has received the most threats from the Islamic State in its videos, with more than 25 
						in two years. France is next with almost 20 in the same time frame, he said.
