							children from online dangers. The website allows users to create an account to view articles 
							and videos about internet safety as well as post questions and answers in a a forum. Given the 
							correct privileges, a user can also create articles and videos and submit them for validation by 
							the sites administrators on an approval list. A few users are given full privileges, which allow 
							them to approve or disapprove pending videos and articles into the main site. They can also give or

						<p class="paragraph"> The project was worked on as part of a team of two throughout 
							the entire college year. Learning to work cohesively as part of a team was an 
							extremely useful skill to learn from the project. Building the project required 
							many new skills to be learned, and old skills to be improved upon. When the idea 
							for Keep Them Safe was just a concept, research had to be carried out to 
							determine the technologies that would need to be used in the project. 
							<br>
							</br>
							After extensive research, it was decided that building on the knowledge of 
							PHP and MySQL databases that were learned in second year would be an ideal 
							route to take to accomplish the projects goals. As the project was to be 
							completed over the course of the year, weekly and bi-weekly deadlines had to be 
							met. With these deadlines, in addition to multiple other projects that were 
							worked on throughout the year, time management was a skill that had to be learned.
