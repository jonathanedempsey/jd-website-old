					<div class="col-md-9">
						<p class="paragraph"> Census Ireland is a web application that allows users to dynamically interact with 
							data being displayed on a map of Ireland. The data is gathered from the Central Statistics Office 
							(CSO) and Referendum Ireland, with the data being categorized by county. The dashboards primarily 
							focus on the map of Ireland with county borders, this allows users to mouse over specific counties to 
							show data related to that county. The map also acts as an interactive filter. The user can select a 
							single county or multiple counties on the map, this changes the accompanying visualisations to only show 
							data relating to the selected counties. The user can choose between multiple dashboards, each including 
							different sets of data including: Referendum data on marriage equality and the age eligibility for 
							presidency, population data, birth rates and marital status, just to name a few.

					</div>
					
					<div class="col-md-9">
						<p class="paragraph"> The visualisations are created in Tableau, which extracts data from Excel 
							worksheets for each dataset. The census data was primarily acquired through the CSO (Central 
							Statistics Office) website while the referendum data was acquired from Referendum Ireland. The 
							visualisations are uploaded and stored on Tableau Public’s server and are delivered to the front 
							end web application in HTML using the embed code that Tableau Public provides for each visualisation. 
							The site is designed using CSS while the dashboards are designed using Tableau.

						<h1 class="articleSection"> WHAT I LEARNED </h1>
					</div>
					
					<div class="col-md-9">
						<p class="paragraph"> As the project focused on data visualisations, I learned how to determine the best practices on how to implement and 
							create visualisations to make them easy to use and easy to understand. Tableau was 
							a new technology so additional research was done to determine how it could best achieve the 
							projects goals. Data gathering techniques were acquired as the project needed data that could 
							be visualised. One multiple possible data sources were identified, they had to be filtered so
							only data that could be integrated with Tableau was left.
							<br>
							</br>
							Testing was performed on Census Ireland through extensive user and system testing. To 
							determine the applications ease-of-use, ease-of-learning and satisfaction goals participants
							were given pre-test questionnaires, test tasks to perform on the application and post-test
							questionnaires. The results were then analysed and t-tests were carried out. As the project
							was to be completed over the course of the year, weekly and bi-weekly deadlines had to be
							met. With these deadlines, in addition to multiple other projects that were worked on 
							throughout the year, time management was a skill that had to be learned.
